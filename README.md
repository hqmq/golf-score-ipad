# Golf Score Keeper for iPad
This is a sample iPad app built with the following tools:

* [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com)
* [NanoStoreInMotion](https://github.com/siuying/NanoStoreInMotion)
* [Pixate](http://pixate.com)

## Features
This app tries to keep things as simple as possible since it is meant to be read by others.
To that end the feature list is pretty minimal:

* Create a Round
* View/Edit a Round
  * Touch a score and drag up-down to change/set the score
  * Touch a button to add another player to game
  * Touch a player to type their name
  * Touch the course name at the bottom to set the course name
  * Swipe to access holes 10-18
* Save a Round back to golf.riesd.com

Later we might add the following features, perhaps in a different repo to keep this one simple:

* Course name auto-complete suggestions
* Player name auto-complete suggestions
* Show calculated pars for known courses
* Highlight current scores vs calculated pars
